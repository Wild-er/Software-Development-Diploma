            The Residential School System
        </h2>
        <p>
            For a period of more than 150 years, First Nations, Inuit and Métis Nation children were taken from their families 
            and communities to attend schools which were often located far from their homes. More than 150,000 children 
            attended Indian Residential Schools. Many never returned. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first church-run Indian Residential School was opened in 1831. By the 1880s, the federal government 
            had adopted an official policy of funding residential schools across Canada. The explicit intent was to 
            separate these children from their families and cultures. In 1920, the Indian Act made attendance at Indian 
            Residential Schools compulsory for Treaty-status children between the ages of 7 and 15.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) concluded that residential schools were 
            “a systematic, government- sponsored attempt to destroy Aboriginal cultures and languages and to 
            assimilate Aboriginal peoples so that they no longer existed as distinct peoples.” The TRC characterized 
            this intent as “cultural genocide.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The schools were often underfunded and overcrowded. The quality of education was substandard. Children were 
            harshly punished for speaking their own languages. Staff were not held accountable for how they treated the children.
        </p>
        <p>
            We know that thousands of students suffered physical and sexual abuse at residential schools. All suffered 
            from loneliness and a longing to be home with their families.
        </p>
        <p>
            The schools hurt the children. The schools also hurt their families and their communities. Children were 
            deprived of healthy examples of love and respect. The distinct cultures, traditions, languages, and knowledge 
            systems of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples were eroded by forced assimilation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The damages inflicted by Residential Schools continue to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a great many Survivors, talking about their experiences in residential schools means reliving the 
            traumas they experienced. For years, many told no one about what they had endured.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1996, the landmark Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples drew attention to the lasting harm that 
            was done by the residential schools. A growing number of Survivors and their descendants came forward 
            to tell their stories and demand action.

            The discovery of mass graves at former Residential School locations motivated many to create moving
            memorials on the steps of government buildings, as shown in the image above.
